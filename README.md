# Diabetes
Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health parameters. The model uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a medical dataset.


Key Features:

Used a structured dataset with features like glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, etc.

Applied data preprocessing and feature-target separation.

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.

Achieved 79% accuracy on test data.

Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report.



Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.



Output:

Accuracy: 79%

Model interpretable and easy to visualize

Ready for further improvement using pruning or ensemble models
